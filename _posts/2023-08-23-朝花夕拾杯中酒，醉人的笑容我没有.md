# 金句
> When you forgive others, they may not notice but you will heal.
> Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.

> Whenever you have a choice between being right or being kind, be kind.
> No exceptions. Don't confuse kindness with weakness

> Draw to discover what you see.
> Write to discover what you think.
